Sorry man! I couldn’t create notebooks. Lufthansa changed my flight yesterday night and that meant I would have missed my connection at Munich. Fought with them to change it again via frankfurt. Now i don’t have sufficient time in NY to work, which was my plan. The codes are final. The paths need to be changed though. Thanks a lot for doing most of the work with the project!

Code Description:

dataTest.py : This is the file for parsing land data and picking it. Good to copy and paste. Just change the paths.

meds.py : same as above

labTTest.py : I would recommend using a separate notebook for this and commenting out the entire code, since we are not using this anywhere finally. 

getLabCounts, getMedCounts : good to go except the paths.
