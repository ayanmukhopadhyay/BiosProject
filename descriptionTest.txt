The feature space of this problem is extremely large. It is not often that too much data causes a problem but in this case, there is a need to choose features that can be used so that that the model doesn’t under-fit. In order to do so, we looked at lab tests and medication data separately. Each type of lab test was used to check the number of occurrence of the test during each stay. For medicines, each medicine’s count was used separately to see if there is a specific medicine was significant in determining hospital readmissions. For the categorical variables we performed a chi-square test on data for readmissions within 30 days and data without readmission within 30 days, for each medicine type and lab test. For variables that were not categorical, we performed the two-way t-test to determine if the values of such features varies significantly between the two groups. We couldn’t identify features that varied significantly. This is possible because of various reasons. To begin with, medicines may determine readmissions with respect to a specific disease type but not . Also, since medicines are often specific to diseases, there is a problem with missing data when the means are calculated across the entire dataset.

In order to use the medicine and lab data, we used the counts of tests and medicines given to the patients during each stay at the hospital. This corresponds to the total count of medicines, where each dosage of the same disease as treated as one event. We treat the lab tests similarly.
